What would be the best way to visualise all the various systems and the connections between them?One solution supported by hashtag#vega and hashtag#deneb is to use a force directed graph where each node represents an IT system and each edge shows the transfer of data. \u00a0Seeing the data presented in this way give a clear and interactive picture of the IT landscape and is something I wish were available to me when I was a Solution Architect.

This is what is happening today with Daniel Vila Suero, telling us at today's Adigital Academy session about how a Language Model is actually built. From the basic stages of an LLM to specific strategies of how to align a model to the specific needs we may have as a company (from style of answering to avoiding biases or harms). The questions from the Adigital members have been spot on and have enriched the discussion, specially around how companies may actually use existing models and, using alignment techniques, make them useful to them. We're also listening to Daniel talk about the challenges alignment brings to the table in terms of creativity, models prone to satisfying humans so no tough answers are produced.Today's been dense but necessary to understand the inner workings on these complex systems. Next Thursday we will actually see how all this works with real tools.

Intelligence is not a scalar quantity. You can be amazing in one domain, and pretty bad in another (that's what geeks are).2. To dominate, you have to have a drive to dominate. In human societies, domination is rather frowned upon as a way to obtain status. Prestige is preferred. \n\n", "\n\n\n My learnings in hashtag#retrievalaugmentedgeneration come from using the technique for personalized content creation in Yarnit and from brilliant short courses by Harrison Chase and Jerry Liu available at DeepLearning.AI (Thank You! \ud83d\ude4f I'll share the link to the courses in the comments)The value of RAG is in expanding the non-parametric memory of hashtag#llmsThe indexing pipeline enables the creation of a knowledge base for the RAG pipeline.One of the crucial and, perhaps, the more intuitive steps in the indexing pipeline is the splitting of documents into manageable chunks (also called Chunking). There are two reasons for this -1. Large chunks are harder to search and chunking helps in better indexing2. Even though context window sizes are ever expanding, it will always remain a finite number and therefore the retrieved context should be significantly smaller than the context window of the LLM in use.Chunking strategies depend on -1. Nature of the content2. Embedding models you choose3. Length/Complexity of user inputs (limitations of the context window)4. Use CaseLangChain and LlamaIndex both provide effective methods of splitting data. Tiktoken from OpenAI and Open Source Tokenizers from Hugging Face can also be used to create chunks.----I'd also like to thank Roie Schwaber-Cohen at Pinecone for his super informative blog.---If you're interested in more such posts, please follow me Abhinav---Would like to know more about LLMs and stages of the LLM project lifecycle?Download a free version of the notes - https://lnkd.in/df7MQEBf---These notes are a part of \u201cA Complete Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation\u201d that I am in the process of compiling.
