 hashtag#IntelAmbassador The pace of AI innovation continues to accelerate, and during my time at Intel Innovation 2023, I attended Vasudev Lal's session where he spoke about BridgeTower, an open-source vision-language model jointly developed by Intel Corporation and Microsoft Vision-Language (VL) models have been making waves with their impressive performance across a range of tasks. Usually, these models use uni-modal encoders to extract information from visual and textual data and integrate these representations for cross-modal understanding. However, uni-modal encoders can struggle to capture intricate relationships, hampering their performance in complex tasks. There are numerous scenarios where robust vision-language models like BridgeTower will be game-changing. Use cases like image captioning where the elements of the image are well translated to an appropriate and detailed set of keywords. Also, in the healthcare industry, analyzing patient records along with image data like X-ray, MRI or cardiography can be a huge value add. BridgeTower introduces multiple ""bridge layers"" that connect the top layers of uni-modal encoders with each layer of the cross-modal encoder. This innovative approach facilitates a dynamic cross-modal alignment and fusion between visual and textual representations at various semantic levels within the cross-modal encoder. BridgeTower excels with its state-of-the-art performance on just 4M pre-trained images. Achieving 78.73% accuracy on the VQAv2 test-std set, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art model by 1.09%, and with minimal extra resources. When scaled, it reaches an impressive 81.15% accuracy, surpassing models trained on larger datasets. In another article, Regis Pierrard and Anahita Bhiwandiwalla found that Habana Gaudi2 with Optimum Habana is 1.4x faster than H100 and 2.5x faster than A100 80GB with Transformers, a significant advancement for large-scale model training and edge ML deployments. Kudos to Intel and Microsoft for leading the way and providing a robust open-source foundation to build upon. I'm excited to see what the future holds as companies and developers come together to drive AI progress. What would the real-world impact of this tech progress look like in your field?Check out Allie K.

 As an industry data scientist, I have worked on multiple anomaly detection problems in the financial and manufacturing industries. One of the critical aspects of these use-cases is how to build AI models that can process large volumes of data and detect anomalies in real-time. Let's take an example of Fraud detection in financial transactions. With large volumes of transactions happening every second, catching fraudulent activities as they occur can prevent significant and irreversible losses. Real-time anomaly detection models are needed to flag unusual transactions. In this scenario, we need to understand the freshness of the data that we are obtaining from multiple sources. Data processing and transformation pipeline has to adhere to a specific latency, followed by the model's ability to predict and  deliver an output.The magic of using a messaging service like Kafka and an extremely powerful enterprise-grade vector database solution like Singlestore can easily solve use-cases like these and more  🌟 If you are curious about building a real-time data ingestion and model prediction pipeline, along with learning about the latest advancements in the industry, sign up for this exciting webinar now!Date: 4th October 2023, 10:00am PT (10:30pm IST)🖇 Registration Link in the Comments Below 👇 hashtag#ai hashtag#anomalydetection hashtag#ml SingleStore

 🚦Spoiler Alert!  If you’re remotely involved in applying Generative AI to industry use-cases and building AI powered apps, you would want to read on and sign up ASAP!We all know that Generative AI has amazing applications across many industries! General Purpose LLMs such as GPT-4 are trained on widely available public information and are truly incredible. However, to harness the power of these models for your specific industry/use-case, it is very important to train LLMs on domain specific data! This is also called model augmentation.As you may know, this data is often not easy to access, it is stored behind obscure SQL databases, APIs, on-prem file servers and even presentation slides 😅!!Enter LlamaIndex, an open-source data framework to make this data ingestible and easily available for model augmentation. LLamaIndex provides extensible data connectors to ingest data from these disparate sources and prep the data to be consumed by the model. Another feature that I found interesting was the ability to build powerful data indexes to make the data highly performant for model training. LlamaIndex + ChatGPT is a deadly combo 🚀If you’re interested in learning how you can leverage LlamaIndex to integrate powerful LLMs with your domain-specific data, sign up for this exciting webinar happening on Monday!As a surprise, Jerry Liu the Founder of LlamaIndex (Yes!) will be speaking along with Alexander Peng from SingleStore 🙌 If You ♥️ Open Source and Generative AI, do sign up!As always, the webinar is FREE and you will receive the recording for viewing later as well as Github Assets for experimenting.Date: Monday, September 25th, 10:00am PST (10:30 pm IST)🧷 Registration Link in the comments 👇hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#ChatGPT hashtag#machinelearning

 With the large variety of open-source, pre-trained large language models available today, a growing challenge (and opportunity!) is to make it easy and user-friendly to apply these sophisticated models for practical use-cases.An ideal tool should completely abstract the complexities of the underlying algorithm, allowing users to fine-tune and modify parameters to suit their use-cases and run tests using their data in an efficient manner.If you have not heard of Ludwig before, it is an open-source, low code framework that was built to make the process of model development, comparison, and iteration seamless. You can think of it as an abstraction for the model experimentation process. Ludwig provides a set of model architectures that can be combined together to create an end-to-end model for a given use case. In the last release of Ludwig 0.7, the library had capabilities of integrating large language models, but were restricted to predictive tasks like classification and regression.And now! With the latest release, Ludwig 0.8, the developers are now extending support for Generative AI tasks like chatbots, code generation, text summarization, and much more. All of this is made possible using the new “llm” model type.If you’re a data science professional, you will surely relate to some of the infrastructure and tuning problems that Ludwig aims to solve. With this new release, some of the features that have now been integrated are:📌 Declaratively Fine-Tune Large Language Models with the new “llm” model type, allowing users to build text-based Generative AI systems like chatbots, code assistants, etc. without worrying about the infra needed to make everything work with large models and large datasets.📌 Integration with Deepspeed in one config parameter for data + model parallel training, enabling Ludwig to train models too large for a single GPU, or even a single node, with just a single config option📌 Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-rank adaptation (LoRA), dramatically reducing the number of trainable parameters and speeding up fine-tuning considerably.📌 Quantized training with 4-bit and 8-bit compression (QLoRA), enabling fine-tuning LLMs on a single GPU📌 Prompt templating to combine multiple columns from a structured dataset into a single input feature to the LLM📌 Zero-shot and In-context learning (including retrieval augmented ICL) for applying LLMs to solve previously unseen supervised ML tasks without additional trainingI have added a bunch of resources that you would love in the first comment!Happy Learning 🚀hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#datascience hashtag#llm hashtag#genai Predibase

 An overflowing classroom of people!!! 🚀 Google's very first GenAI Live Labs happened in NY yesterday and I was pleased to see an overwhelmingly positive response from our customers.I got the opportunity to lead the GenAI workshop and talk about Google Cloud's GenAI offerings, run through the PaLM model access via SDK, and dig deep into industry use-cases with the customers. We spoke about prompt engineering, prompt tuning, and fine tuning of the models in relevant use-cases. I was pleasantly surprised to see how engaged the customers were to discuss about the their business use-case and go much beyond what we had in the agenda and talk about LMOps (Large Model Ops) and Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF). The classroom was overflowing with people (as you can see in the pictures).We had Philip Moyer and Patricia Florissi, Ph. D. talk about the GenAI product google is building both for consumers and enterprises. Then we had Madeleine Clare Elish, PhD talk extensively about the Responsible AI considerations (which is of utmost importance to Google). Ben Royce led a breakout session for leaderships and decision makers to understand the strategies they need to house GenAI applications in their organization. We had 2 breakout rooms for hands-on workshop on our GenAI products and to discuss about the enterprise use-case which Ram Seshadri and I led. One of the interesting things that came out when we were comparing our notes post our sessions, was how excited the customers were to connect the products to their use-cases! We had a lot of takeaways from this session which will help us improve on the hands-on session.I am looking forward to two more GenAI Live Labs session in SF (23rd May) and Seattle (25th May) coming up next week. (Don't worry we have plenty of them planned for various different cities in the next months 😄)If you are a GCP customer and are interested to attend the GenAI Live Labs in your city or learn more about our offerings, reach out to me!!We are in very exciting times and a huge shoutout to our leaders Lee Moore, Brad Little, Matthew Dauphinée, and Carolyn Ujcic for ensuring we are at the forefront to help enterprises make most of the Generative AI capabilities to transform their businesses.

 Here is one of the latest addition to our DocAI workbench 🔥Businesses often face challenges in managing the inflow of unclassified documents, which can hinder their ability to scale and automate processes effectively. Let's look at a financial organization receiving tens of documents per customer and need to validate the document. This would take lot of manual hours and is prone to human error. To address these challenges, Google Cloud has launched Custom Document Classifier (CDC) as part of DocumentAI Workbench.CDC is a new feature that allows businesses to train highly accurate machine learning models to automatically classify document types. This has tangible benefits such as reducing review time and cost, and enabling better automation of downstream processes, such as selecting proper storage, analysis, or processing steps; and most importantly provide a seamless way for organizations to scale their solution.If you're interested in learning more about how CDC can improve your document management processes, check out our latest blog post. https://lnkd.in/ePpibHBtKudos to Derek Egan and his team 👏hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#google hashtag#documentai hashtag#cloud

 Sunny Weekend in SoCal ☀️I had the extreme privilege to be invited to the University of California, Los Angeles to deliver a 3 hour course on Applied Time Series using Python for students from the Master of Quantitative Economics at UCLA . There were 100+ students who attended and I had really insightful conversations during my office hours chatting with students. I also got some really thought provoking questions regarding the different applications of Time Series Analysis in the field of quantitative finance and social sciences.I also used the opportunity to visit Google’s unique Playa Vista office that is built inside the Spruce Goose Airplane Hangar. I highly recommend watching the Aviator to learn about Howard Hughes and his magnificent plane.Another highlight was seeing the highly anticipated Tesla Cybertruck in the “Inside Tesla” exhibit at Petersen Automotive museum in LA.Thank you to UCLA for this wonderful opportunity ❤️hashtag#datascience hashtag#learning hashtag#motivation

 A while ago I had made a video about Ethical Issues with Generative AI. As a Data Science practitioner, I believe strongly about Responsible AI principles. I saw this video published by Forbes this morning talking Generative AI and how it would impact human lives. This is by far THE MOST DETAILED report presented on Generative AI. This video covers various ethical issues about Generative AI in terms of bias, misinformation, model hallucinations, privacy protection, and copyrighting. PS: Bill Gates' thoughts on Generative AI has been included in the video, especially around providing basic medical support in remote neighborhoods and providing educational support/ tutoring for lower income neighborhoods.Highly recommend to watch this: https://lnkd.in/gQMwCcMehashtag#datascience hashtag#ai hashtag#generativeai

 This afternoon I was sitting and thinking of something that I wrote down to send to my graphic artist for him to create visuals/animation based on what I had written down. Force of habit of using the Bard and ChapGPT for the last few weeks, I started thinking- if it is possible to have a Generative AI that could take my text notes and output video.A little search and I found ""Make-A-Video"" a generative AI solution by Meta. I tried signing up for their product but the link was broken. A pretty interesting paper that is published by Meta. Wish I could try out the product.

 For anyone in my network impacted by layoff and on H-1B Visa. You may be able to extend from the 60 day rule to 1 year based on hardship. Link and details to USCIS below. PLEASE POST AND RESHARE TO YOUR NETWORKS FOR AWARENESS.Period of Authorized Stay - Compelling Circumstances Employment Authorization DocumentWorkers who are the beneficiary of an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) may be eligible for a compelling circumstances EAD for up to one year if they:- do not have an immigrant visa available to them in the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin, and- face compelling circumstances.Note: A compelling circumstances EAD is a discretionary stopgap measure intended to assist certain individuals on the path to lawful permanent residence by preventing the need to abruptly leave the United States. Workers who begin working on a compelling circumstances EAD will no longer be maintaining nonimmigrant status but generally will be considered to be in a period of authorized stay and will not accrue unlawful presence in the United States while the EAD is valid. More information about eligibility requirements and the application process can be found on our Employment Authorization in Compelling Circumstances page.

 As someone who is an immigrant, I empathize on the anxiousness and uncertainty one has to go through while being on H1B. I myself have felt the anxiousness of ""What if I get laid-off"" ?It can be emotionally draining if you are in this situation and is difficult to wear the practicality hat. In the past, few people had reached out to me for help and I have shared with them a list of resources I created that talks about various avenues that one can considered if you are in this unfortunate situation. I believe sharing this with the wider audience is important. Also, making a video instead of a document, so there is no scope of confusion in what I am sharing. Any of the tips that I have shared is after consulting a couple of lawyers and reading a bunch of USCIS resources. While this would be a good place to start but I would also encourage you to speak to your organization's lawyer to get more details and how you should pursue it.  Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions about these options. Happy to help :)Update: My last post caption came across as tone deaf to some people and I acknowledge their opinion, so I have changed the post to better reflect my intention to create the resource.https://lnkd.in/gQ6w8wSW hashtag#google hashtag#tech hashtag#help hashtag#layoffs

 As a Data Science practitioner, one thing that I have learnt is that just learning technical concepts and implementation isn't enough skills to be able to build solutions for organizations. You ask why? Because not all are technical, and those who are aren't the ones who are going to be making business decisions. Business Leads and Strategists are the ""users"" who are going to be using data science insights to reinforce their business decisions, and hence it is critical that applications cater to these users in an efficient manner. This is where Semantic Layer comes into play. A semantic layer can be thought of as a business representation of data. It offers the user a unified and consolidated view of data across an organization. Semantic layer lets you create a unified, consistent and singular view of data from different data definitions from different data sources, for analytics and other business purposes.If you are interested to learn more about Semantic Layer, join The 2nd annual Semantic Layer Summit!

 Response will always be as smart as your question 😉Well, most of you who have used ChatGPT in any capacity will understand this.Since large language models gained popularity with the data science community, prompt engineering has been one of the major areas of research. You may ask what is prompt engineering? In the simplest of definitions, prompt engineering is the art of curating set of statements/questions for which is used to get best quality output from a machine learning model.Why is this important? 🤔With Generative AI systems being integrated in real-world applications, it is critical to know not just ""how to use them"" but also ""what can they do"". You might have recently seen people sharing examples of how ChatGPT can be used for getting essays written, or performance review, or getting career tips; but there is a whole lot of usecases that can be achieved using a Generative AI system like ChatGPT. The dataset it has been trained on is humongous and covers a wide breath of subject matter expertise. I am working on a really interesting application using ChatGPT and will be announcing it soon 😉There are some amazing prizes to be given out! Are you excited? What do you think it is going to be ?

 The best practice of moving from Model Centric AI to Data Centric AI was based on the importance to understand, validate, and process the data in a standard and informed manner. In Model Centric AI practice, the focus was on how to build better algorithms that can fit your data best and also generalize. BUT, the major assumption behind this was that the data is already in a ""good"" state.This assumption proved out to be not true for almost all cases. With the Data Centric AI approach we build pipelines that performs data documentation, data quality assessment, data preprocessing for bad data quality, data validation, train-test split validation as part of the ""Data Pipeline"". This follows the model validation and model monitoring in the model pipeline. In the next few posts I will be digging deeper into different modules of Data Centric AI pipeline and sharing some tools and examples on how to build a Data Centric AI pipeline.In the meantime, here is something I would highly recommend you to watch : https://lnkd.in/gMZiYkYWStay tuned! hashtag#ai hashtag#algorithms hashtag#data hashtag#datacentricai

 One of the profound challenges of building a robust model pipeline and a data pipeline is to continuously monitor the models in production and the incoming data. Trends change, patterns change, seasonality changes, user behavior changes, and all of this can impact how your model performs in production, which in-turn will cause business disruptions.I believe having model monitoring as part of your MLOps workflow is critical to really have a robust pipeline that is integrated with multiple downstream applications. I have invited Wani Sharma, Senior Product Manager at Wallaroo.AI to share more insights about model monitoring and drift.Sign up for FREE Community Edition here: https://lnkd.in/gdX5U6KQIn part 1 of the video, we talk about why is model monitoring important, and how it fits in the MLOps pipeline. Watch Part 1: https://lnkd.in/dfwePw8HIn part 2 of the video, we will be talking about some business use-cases for using model monitoring and how it impacts the business. In the next part you will also see me using Wallaroo.ai's Community Edition tool for model monitoring called ""Assay"" which is absolutely FREE for any data scientist to use!Watch Part 2: https://lnkd.in/duNQ3vJFIn the comments below, don't forget to share your thoughts 💙hashtag#datascience hashtag#ml hashtag#mlops

 Do you know how ChatGPT was trained? ChatGPT is ""simply"" a fined-tuned GPT-3 model with a surprisingly small amount of data! Moreover, ChatGPT is using 1.3B parameters where GPT-3 uses 175B parameters! It is first fine-tuned with supervised learning and then further fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. They hired 40 human labelers to generate the training data. Let's dig into it!- First, they started by a pre-trained GPT-3 model trained on a broad distribution of Internet data (https://lnkd.in/gAUtxvrM). Then sampled typical human prompts used for GPT collected from the OpenAI website and asked labelers and customers to write down the correct output. They fine-tuned the model with 12,725 labeled data. - Then, they sampled human prompts and generated multiple outputs from the model for each of the prompt. A labeler is then asked to rank those outputs. The resulting data is used to train a Reward model (https://lnkd.in/gdrzdWu3) with 33,207 prompts and ~10 times more training samples using different combination of the ranked outputs.- We then sample more human prompts and they are used to fine-tuned the supervised fine-tuned model with Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO), a Reinforcement Learning algorithm (https://lnkd.in/gsDTWtga). The prompt is fed to the PPO model, the Reward model generates a reward value, and the PPO model is iteratively fine-tuned using the rewards and the prompts using 31,144 prompts data.This process is fully described in here: https://lnkd.in/gnt9K9pu. The paper actually details a model called InstructGPT which is described by OpenAI as a ""sibling model"" to ChatGPT, so the numbers shown above may be slightly different from the exact ones used  for ChatGPT.---I offer Machine Learning consulting services: https://lnkd.in/gqzuB6kMI offer Data Science career mentoring: https://lnkd.in/gGBMXuR4 I am starting writing on Twitter as well now.

 Yes, ChatGPT is very powerful, revolutionary even, but let's calm down...Our jobs aren't gone just yet...✅What happened?Following the launch of ChatGPT, OpenAI's conversational bot.  Posts announcing the obsolescence of content creators, SEOs, and developers invaded Twitter and LinkedIn feeds.But these people forget that Google exists... Two days ago, Google rolled out its HCU ( google helpful content update ) Globally.✅What is the purpose of this update? It will help Google's systems to detect low-quality content created for search engines and not for people.In the same vein Duy Nguyen, who works at Google said in a conference five days ago:  𝑮𝒐𝒐𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝒉𝒂𝒔 ""𝒂𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎𝒔 𝒕𝒐 𝒈𝒐 𝒂𝒇𝒕𝒆𝒓"" 𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒔𝒆 𝒘𝒉𝒐 𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒕 𝑨𝑰 𝒑𝒍𝒂𝒈𝒊𝒂𝒓𝒊𝒛𝒆𝒅 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕, 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒂𝒍𝒈𝒐𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒉𝒎𝒔 𝒄𝒂𝒏 ""𝒅𝒆𝒎𝒐𝒕𝒆 𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒆 𝒔𝒄𝒓𝒂𝒑𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓 𝒔𝒊𝒕𝒆𝒔.""💡Beware, Google is not the only one. Stack Overflow, the devs' platform banned code generated by artificial intelligence because it contained errors and misled people. Same with Getty Images, that said AI-generated images pose legal challenges.✅Morality of the post? ChatGPT ( and other AIs) will revolutionize our lives but we are not obsolete; at least not yet :) So what is ChatGPD useful for? Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google has an excellent post; Check it out here:https://t.ly/o-od Want to know more about the helpful content update?

 I have seen a lot of people making these mistakes and thought of explicitly putting this information out there for you.1) Being a wanna-be: Big NO NO for putting names of companies where you don't work on your headline. I have seen a lot of people working on a technology like Google Cloud, AWS or Azure in a consulting company and adding ""Google Cloud"", ""AWS"" or ""Azure"" on their headline. Remember your headline is to mention your affiliation/ achievements/ field of expertise(like machine learning, NLP, reinforcement learning etc), not tools. By putting random brand names, you are likely to be judged as a wanna-be by the recruiters/hiring managers or people viewing your profile in general.2) Cold-emailing: Don't email/message people without introducing yourself and giving them context. Don't directly ask for a favor or referral in the very first message. Try to establish a good communication and maybe have an informational interview with them initially. Always start with a brief introduction, why you are contacting them, and what are you expecting.3) Politically incorrect things: Don't write a post or comment about politically incorrect things or personal attacking someone. I have seen in multiple instances where people make derogatory remarks on someone's post or make statements that can be a personal attack on a person or a community. Having an inclusive and unbiased mindset is really important to grow in your professional life. These qualities are what makes a strong leader, not just their field of expertise. hashtag#cloud hashtag#hiring hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#technology hashtag#work hashtag#community hashtag#people hashtag#learning hashtag#communication hashtag#brand hashtag#like hashtag#mindset hashtag#nlp hashtag#interview hashtag#consulting hashtag#leader hashtag#email hashtag#recruiters hashtag#licreatoraccelerator
